Hello, I'm a Senior Research Associate in the [NLIP Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) & [ALTA Institute](http://www.wiki.cl.cam.ac.uk/clwiki/NaturalLanguage/ALTA), based in the [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), U.K. I'm also a member of the [Cambridge Language Sciences](https://www.languagesciences.cam.ac.uk) network.

I've been on the staff at the University since October 2013, having previously worked in Literature Services at the [European Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.ebi.ac.uk), carried out research for [English Profile](http://www.englishprofile.org), and studied for a PhD in what was the Research Centre for English & Applied Linguistics (before its amalgamation into the section of Theoretical & Applied Linguistics) from 2006 to 2010.

You can find out more about my research, teaching and outreach activities by exploring the rest of my site, my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=2M1Jo3sAAAAJ) profile, my [webpage](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~apc38) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cainesap) feed.
